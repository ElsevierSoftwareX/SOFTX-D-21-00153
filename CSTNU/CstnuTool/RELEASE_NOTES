RELEASE NOTES
=============START SNIPPET: rn

v1.7.4
------
	date:	2015-09-13
	
	In this release, a more strict check of contingent links has been introduced.
	Bounds of a contingent link A==[x,y]==>B must observe the property 0<x<y<∞. 
	Moreover, since for CSTNU instances it is not yet defined the concept of 'instantaneous reactions', it is not possible to define
	a CSTNU instance in which there exists a constraint like C--[0,0]-->B where B is contingent.
	This constraint requires that C has to be executed in at the same time of the contingent time point B, but this is not possible 
	because B is decided by the environment and the runtime engine has to observe it before to execute standard node like C.
	
v1.7.3
------
	date:	2015-09-10
	
	This release contains some minor bug fixes and a revision of public methods of class it.univr.di.cstnu.CSTNU.
	Now, it is possible to check the controllability of a cstn instance instantiating a CSTNU object and calling its
	dynamicControllabilityCheck(LabeledIntGraph) method.
	It is sufficient to create a LabeledIntGraph object representing a given cstnu instance (in LabeledIntGraph class there is also a method for loading 
	an instance from a file written in GraphML format), instantiate a CSTNU object and call its method dynamicControllabilityCheck(LabeledIntGraph) passing 
	the created graph.
	
	Moreover, I add the class it.univr.di.cstnu.CSTNURunningTime and the script CSTNURunningTime for checking a bundle of cstnu instances obtaining also 
	some execution time statistics.

v1.7.2
------
	date:	2015-06-24
	
	This release contains some minor bug fixes and a README file explaining the proposed examples of CSTNU/CSTN instances.
	Thanks to Huan Wang for his comments.
	 
v1.7.1
------
	date:	2015-05-28

	This release contains a faster Dynamic Consistency check for CSTNs.
	The java class <<<CSTN.java>>> has been completely rewritten and almost optimized for a faster check.

v1.7.0
------
	date:	2015-03-23

	This release is the first public release.
