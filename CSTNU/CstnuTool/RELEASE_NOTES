RELEASE NOTES
=============START SNIPPET: rn

v1.7.3
------
	date:	2015-09-10
	
	This release contains some minor bug fixes and a revision of public methods of class it.univr.di.cstnu.CSTNU.
	Now, it is possible to check the controllability of a cstn instance instantiating a CSTNU object and calling its
	dynamicControllabilityCheck(LabeledIntGraph) method.
	It is sufficient to create a LabeledIntGraph object representing a given cstnu instance (in LabeledIntGraph class there is also a method for loading 
	an instance from a file written in GraphML format), instantiate a CSTNU object and call its method dynamicControllabilityCheck(LabeledIntGraph) passing 
	the created graph.
	
	Moreover, I add the class it.univr.di.cstnu.CSTNURunningTime and the script CSTNURunningTime for checking a bundle of cstnu instances obtaining also 
	some execution time statistics.

v1.7.2
------
	date:	2015-06-24
	
	This release contains some minor bug fixes and a README file explaining the proposed examples of CSTNU/CSTN instances.
	Thanks to Huan Wang for his comments.
