CSTNU INSTANCES README
======================

In this directory there are the following files representing CSTN/CSTNU
instances:

TIME2015Benchmark
-----------------
Directory containing some big CSTN instances for TIME 2015 paper.

4Alt.cstnu
----------
Instance representing a process with 5 tasks, 2 alternative ones (after observation time-point A?) followed by one and, then, by other two alternative tasks 
(after observation time point B?)
The network is dynamic controllable (DC). 
In the DC check,   
Rule R0 has been applied 10 times.
Rule R1 has been applied 1 times.
Rule R2 has been applied 9 times.
Rule R3 has been applied 12 times.
Rule R4 has been applied 15 times.
Rule R5 has been applied 48 times.
Rule R6 has been applied 0 times.
Rule ObsCaseRule has been applied 0 times.
Rule NoCaseLabel has been applied 807 times.

4Alt.cstnu.tga.q and 4Alt.cstnu.tga.xml represent the translation of the network in TIGA format.


4AlternativeWFpaths.cstn
------------------------
It similar to 4Alt.cstnu but where tasks are without uncertainty.
The network is dynamic consistent (DC).
In the DC check,
Rule R0 has been applied 3 times.
Rule R1 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R2 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R3 has been applied 43 times.
Rule Labeled Propagation has been applied 852 times.
The global execution time has been 511 ms. approx.

4AlternativeWFpaths.cstn.tga.q 4AlternativeWFpaths.cstn.tga.xml represent the translation of the network in TIGA format.

ex1C.cstnu
----------
Simple CSTNU representing a process with two nested alternatives and three tasks.
The network is dynamic controllable (DC). 
In the DC check, 
Rule R0 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R1 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R2 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R3 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R4 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R5 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R6 has been applied 0 times.
Rule ObsCaseRule has been applied 0 times.
Rule NoCaseLabel has been applied 86 times.

ex1C.cstnu.tga.q and ex1C.cstnu.tga.xml represent the translation of the network in TIGA format.

ex2C.cstn
---------
Simple CSTN in which there are only one observation time-point ('A?') and three other time-points: 'n1' is in scenario 'Â¬a', 'n2' in scenario 'a' and 
'n3' always present as 'A?'. 
The network is dynamic consistent (DC). 
In the DC check, 
Rule R0 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R1 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R2 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R3 has been applied 1 times.
Rule Labeled Propagation has been applied 16 times.
The global execution time has been 6 ms. approx.

ex2C.cstn.tga.q and ex2C.cstn.tga.xml represent the translation of the network in TIGA format.

ex2NC.cstn
----------
It is like ex2C.cstn instance but made UNCONSISTENT setting the overall constraint between 'A?' and 'n3' more stringent.
The network is NOT dynamic consistent (DC). 

ex2NC.cstn.tga.q and ex2NC.cstn.tga.xml represent the translation of the network in TIGA format.
***BE CAREFUL***
TIGA finds ex2NC.cstn.tga.xml DC and propose a strategy. 
There is an error. We are investigating on it.


fig2Paper.cstnu
---------------
Another simple CSTNU representing a process with two nested alternatives and 3 tasks.
The network is dynamic controllable (DC). 
In the DC check, 
Rule R0 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R1 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R2 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R3 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R4 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R5 has been applied 0 times.
Rule R6 has been applied 0 times.
Rule ObsCaseRule has been applied 0 times.
Rule NoCaseLabel has been applied 17 times.

fig2Paper.cstnu.tga.q and fig2Paper.cstnu.tga.xml represent the translation of the network in TIGA format.
